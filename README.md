## Introduction

I created this project as part of the Udacity React Nanodegree Program
to get more practice creating a React frontend using Redux to manage the
store. It is a simplified version of popular message boards like Reddit, 
and allows users to create, edit, and delete posts and comments without
needing to log in.

## Installation

This project is very easy to install. Just clone the git repository, use
the terminal to navigate to the Readable directory, and then you will
notice the frontend directory and api-server directory. Navigate to the
frontend directory, run `npm install` and `npm start` to install the 
necessary dependencies and start the frontend server. It will
automatically open the frontend in your default browswer. Then, cd 
into the api-server folder and run `node server` to start the backend,
which is necessary for the Readable app to run. The frontend runs on 
localhost 3000 and the backend runs on localhost 3001.

## Usage

Once the Readable App is open in the browser, it is easy to navigate
the different parts of the website and use the different features.
Users can view the different categories and posts in a list or
in more detail. The sort buttons allow users to sort by date or
score. The backend supplies some posts already made, but users
can add or delete as much as they want. 

Thanks for reading! Have fun with the Readble App.
